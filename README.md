# About the project 

The minority rights project aims to create a database that tracks when various minority rights were codified into law across countries and time as well as track when, where, and which parties endorsed minority rights. The database will eventually help us answer whether endorsing or passing laws which “get ahead of public opinion”, particularly in the context of minority rights, harms parties in the short term and/or help them in the long term? 

The database will contain two datasets: the first will trace the introduction and codification of minority rights at the country-year level and the second will trace the endorsement of minority rights by party at the party-country-year level. 

# Instructions 

1. Tasks will be assigned as issues. You should receive a notification when an issue is assigned to you.
2. Download GitHub desktop and clone this repository (Code > Open with GitHub Desktop).
3. Each member of the team should have a designated folder. Please add your work to these folders, unless it is a document on which we are all working together. To create your folder, on your desktop, go to the Github folder > minority_rights and create a folder with your name and add the files you are working on in this folder. If you add them locally, you will have to push the changes to the repository. You can also add files directly to GitHub. Note: You can create a markdown file and add links to external documents (like Google Drive) in this markdown file.
