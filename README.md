# About the project 

The minority rights project aims to create a database that tracks when various minority rights were codified into law across countries and time as well as track when, where, and which parties endorsed minority rights. The database will eventually help us answer whether endorsing or passing laws which “get ahead of public opinion”, particularly in the context of minority rights, harms parties in the short term and/or help them in the long term? 

The database will contain two datasets: the first will trace the introduction and codification of minority rights at the country-year level and the second will trace the endorsement of minority rights by party at the party-country-year level.
